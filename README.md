# Reactive Recipes

Active demo here: https://reactive-kitchen-manager.firebaseapp.com

A project aimed to teach me reactJS, and to possibly create a useful app that helps you stay on top of your groceries, using AI to help you figure out what would be best for your next meal based on your preferences and the ingredients available.

Currently I've implemented a basic barcode scanner and built the material ui.
